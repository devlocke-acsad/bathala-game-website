## 🎯 Game Lore

In the beginning, the divine union of Bathala and Amihan created the islands—a paradise where elemental spirits lived in perfect balance. But this harmony was shattered when the *engkanto* (spirits of lies and illusion) corrupted the noble guardians of nature.

A prophecy foretells of a hero who can master the sacred elemental deck and mend the fractured world. That hero is you.
